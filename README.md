## Technologies Used
The following languages/technologies were used in the process of making this website

* Javascript (ES6 & ES7+)

## What I've learnt (There's alot)
I've learnt alot about best practices and the advanced concepts of Javascript. I'm extremely comfortable with vanilla Javascript at as whole
* Interacting with API's
* How to use JSON data in Javascript
* Using promises and async / await in practical use (Concepts were not too hard to grasp!)
* Writing cleaner more configurable code. I've still yet to decide between OOP (Classes) and FP (Functions) though. I believe FP is best for the time being
* Better CSS animations
* Why to avoid using InnerHTML with Javascript (Very big security risks!)
* Better file structuring, I find it much better to split things into components and their own seperate files.
* Scroll animations
* Implementing styled vanilla Javascript components in HTML
* How to write re-usable easy customisable code

### What's next?
I'd like to continue making company mockup sites to continue practicing the construction of websites, and really get a feel for how long it takes to do real world projects.
* E-Commerce App (With Node.js)
* Portfolio Site
* Blog Site
* Company Landing Pages (Many)
* Cryptocurrency & currency converter
