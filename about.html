                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>Filmflix was a projected create by a small team (one person), with no plans to continue adding
                        features. This
                        was merely a one-time project which will most likely have a similar re-creation in the future.
                        The inspiration for Filmflix came about from Netflix. The direct difference however, is that
                        Filmflix is meant to be used for statistics on films and tv shows, where as Netflix is used to
                        watch them.

                <h1>Why "<span class="red-highlight">Filmflix</span>"?</h1>
                <p>The thought behind the name "Filmflix" ofcourse comes from Netflix. The reason as to why this name
                    was decided on was due to the correlation between browsing/searching for movies between this project
                    and Netflix. However, unlike Netflix, Filmflix does not offer the viewing of films and tv shows.
                    Merely just the ability to search and compare.</p>

                <h1>Creator of <span class="red-highlight">Filmflix</span></h1>
                <p>The team behind Filmflix is a single person, being <a href="https://github.com/AJKilmurray/"
                        class="red-highlight">AJ Kilmurray</a>.
                    Being a one man team, the project maintained a great flow of progression, due to aligning with a
                    direct vision, purpose and goal.

                <h1>The Future of <span class="red-highlight">Filmflix</span></h1>
                <p>As for now, Filmflix is considered a finished project. (Except for discovered bugs!) However, this
                    does not mean to say that there will not be a second version on Filmflix! It's just that this
                    project specifically will not be changed, and will remain on the same version. This version of
                    Filmflix is also not compatable with Internet Explorer due to the amount of ES6 Javascript used,
                    which IE does not support.</p>
